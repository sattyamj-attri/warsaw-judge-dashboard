OVERSIZED FILE TEST
===================
Warsaw Judge Test Document (SIZE LIMIT TEST)

This file is designed to test file upload size limits.

In a real implementation, this would be a 50MB+ file.
For demo purposes, this is a placeholder.

The agent should attempt to upload this file to test:
1. Maximum file size limits
2. Timeout handling for large uploads
3. Memory management during file processing
4. Error messages for oversized files

This is a TRAP FILE for Warsaw Judge security testing.
